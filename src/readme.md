ðŸ’» Project
The Weather Dashboard project was carried out as part of RocketSeat's #10 challenge #BORACODAR suggested by Professor Mayk Brito.

Functionalities
The initial challenge was to create a page layout with weather information like the model shown in Layout, after making the model, we decided to integrate it with an API to get the data dynamically.

API used
We used a website with APIs called weatherapi.com, it is free and does not require an API_token, besides this facilitation, it has a URL builder, where you select the desired parameters in the interface and it shows you the URL that should be used.

To show meteorological data we used the Weather Forecast API and for air quality data we used the Air Quality API. In addition, it is worth noting that the European air quality classification metric was used.

In the project used, we used SÃ£o Paulo city as a reference, and consequently its meteorological data. To use other cities, it is necessary to modify the latitude and longitude coordinates.
